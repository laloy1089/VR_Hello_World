# VR_Hello_World

In it, please include your name, how long it took to complete the project, and one thing you liked and one thing that was challenging about this project.


Name: Lauren Aloy

How Long it took: About 3 hours

One thing I liked: How simple it was to follow the directions to create this project.

One thing that was challenging: I ran into errors within Xcode and there was nothing within course that could help me with this. As always turned to google and ended up figuring it out, but it ate into some time.
